\section{General comments}

$\star$ I thank all the students who did the job during the lockdown. It wasn't that easy for you to stay motivated.

And most of you really managed to do it!

You can be proud of you.

$\star$ As I've put some corrections in your scripts, the following comments are on words/expressions you mispronounced.

Sometimes you don't put the stress in the right place in the word you are pronouncing.

$\star$ To check the pronunciation, I remind you that you have many options.

I've put some useful links in this webmix:
